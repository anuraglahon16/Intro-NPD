  <h2 id="early" class="middle">Early Life</h2>
  <div class="earlylife">
  <b>  Zuckerberg</b> was born in 1984 in White Plains, New York. He is the son of Karen (Kempner), a psychiatrist, and Edward Zuckerberg, a dentist.His ancestors came from Germany, Austria and Poland. He and his three sisters, Randi, Donna, and Arielle, were brought up in Dobbs Ferry, New York, a small Westchester County village about 21 miles north of Midtown Manhattan. Zuckerberg was raised Jewish and had his Bar Mitzvah when he turned 13.

    At Ardsley High School, Zuckerberg excelled in classes. He transferred to the exclusive private school Phillips Exeter Academy, in New Hampshire, in his junior year, where he won prizes in science (math, astronomy, and physics) and classical studies. On his college application, Zuckerberg claimed that he could read and write French, Hebrew, Latin, and ancient Greek. He was captain of the fencing team.

    <b>Zuckerberg</b> began using computers and writing software in middle school. His father taught him Atari BASIC Programming in the 1990s, and later hired software developer David Newman to tutor him privately. Newman calls him a "prodigy", adding that it was "tough to stay ahead of him". Zuckerberg took a graduate course in the subject at Mercy College near his home while still in high school. He enjoyed developing computer programs, especially communication tools and games. In one program, since his father's dental practice was operated from their home, he built a software program he called "ZuckNet" that allowed all the computers between the house and dental office to communicate with each other. It is considered a "primitive" version of AOL's Instant Messenger, which came out the following year

<div class="career_1">
  On February 4, 2004,<b> Zuckerberg</b> launched Facebook from his<b> Harvard</b> dormitory room. An earlier inspiration for Facebook may have come from Phillips Exeter Academy, the prep school from which Zuckerberg graduated in 2002. It published its own student directory, "The Photo Address Book", which students referred to as "The Facebook". Such photo directories were an important part of the student social experience at many private schools. With them, students were able to list attributes such as their class years, their friends, and their telephone numbers.
Zuckerberg, Moskovitz and some friends moved to Palo Alto, California —the home of Silicon Valley — where they leased a small house that served as an office. Over the summer, Zuckerberg met Peter Thiel, who invested in the company. They got their first office in mid-2004. According to Zuckerberg, the group planned to return to Harvard, but eventually decided to remain in California.They had already turned down offers by major corporations to buy the company. In an interview in 2007, Zuckerberg explained his reasoning: "It's not because of the amount of money. For me and my colleagues, the most important thing is that we create an open information flow for people. Having media corporations owned by conglomerates is just not an attractive idea to me."

<h2 id="phil" class="middle">Philanthropy</h2>
<div class="philanthropy">
On December 1, 2015, <b>Zuckerberg</b> and Chan announced the birth of their daughter Max, and in an open letter to Max, they pledged to donate 99 percent of their Facebook shares, then valued at US$45 billion, to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, their new organization that will focus on health and education. The donation will not be given immediately, but over the course of their lives.However, instead of forming a charitable corporation to donate the value of the stock to, as<b> Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Larry Page, Sergey Brin</b> and other<em> tech billionaires</em> have done, Zuckerberg and Chan chose to use the structure of a limited liability company. This has drawn criticism from a number of journalists.

<div class="depictions">
  A movie based on Zuckerberg and the founding years of Facebook, The Social Network was released on October 1, 2010, and stars Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg. After Zuckerberg was told about the film, he responded, "I just wished that nobody made a movie of me while I was still alive."

On January 29, 2011,<b>Zuckerberg</b> made a surprise guest appearance on<em>Saturday Night Live</em>, which was being hosted by<em>Jesse Eisenberg</em>. They both said it was the first time they ever met.Eisenberg asked Zuckerberg, who had been critical of his portrayal by the film, what he thought of the movie. Zuckerberg replied, "It was interesting." In a subsequent interview about their meeting, Eisenberg explains that he was "nervous to meet him, because I had spent now, a year and a half thinking about him " He adds, "Mark has been so gracious about something that is really so uncomfortable.The fact that he would do SNL and make fun of the situation is so sweet and so generous. It is the best possible way to handle something that, I think, could otherwise be very uncomfortable."
